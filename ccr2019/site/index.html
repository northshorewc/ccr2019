<h2 id="cryptosporidium-monitoring">Cryptosporidium Monitoring</h2>
<p>Cryptosporidium is a microscopic protozoan that, when ingested, can result in diarrhea, fever, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The organism is found in many surface water sources (lakes, rivers, streams) and comes from human and animal wastes in the watershed. The NSWC uses an effective treatment process that is designed to remove and inactivate this pathogen.</p>
<p>Cryptosporidium is being monitored in the raw water in compliance with the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. In 2018, <strong>no cryptosporidium was detected</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="turbidity">Turbidity</h2>
<p>In accordance with s. NR 810.29, Wisconsin Administrative Code, the treated surface water is monitored for turbidity to confirm that the filtered water is less than 0.30 NTU. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water. We monitor for turbidity because it is a good indicator of the effectiveness of our filtration system. During the year, the highest single entry point turbidity measurement was 0.17 NTU. The lowest monthly percentage of samples meeting the turbidity limits was 100 percent.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="regulatory-compliance">Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>We are proud to report that our system has not violated a maximum contaminant level or any other water quality standard. The following tables list the contaminants that were detected. This report may contain up to five years worth of water quality results. If tested annually, or more frequently, the results from the most recent year are shown on this report. If testing is done less frequently, the results are shown from the most recent testing event. The NSWC and its member water utilities are allowed to test for some contaminants less frequently than once per year.</p>
<p>Please note that the term "level found" is used throughout this report. The meaning of "level found" will vary depending on how many samples were collected in a year and the particular regulation it pertains to. If a contaminant was tested once in a year, a single value will be reported as "level found." If contaminant was tested more than one time during the year, the minimum and maximum values (range) will be reported below the level found in parentheses.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-results-pertaining-to-the-north-shore-water-commission-pws-24135155">Monitoring Results Pertaining to the North Shore Water Commission (PWS# 24135155)</h3>
<p>The NSWC and its member utilities work together to ensure the water it delivers meets or exceeds all standards set forth by its regulatory agencies. The following sections show the contaminants that were detected by the NSWC in its monitoring. Please note that we did not test for radon during 2018 because we were not required to.</p>

<p><em>Lead and Copper</em></p>
<p>In 2018, the NSWC was responsible for lead and copper monitoring. To comply with this regulation, the NSWC worked with its member water utilities and the WDNR to determine where to collect samples and how to collect them. The monitoring results listed in this section are from water samples collected in homes that was confirmed to have a lead service in Fox Point, Glendale, and Whitefish Bay. During this sampling event, 10 were from Fox Point, 11 from Glendale, and 71 from Whitefish Bay.</p>
<p>Going forward, Fox Point, Glendale, and Whitefish Bay will be regulated separately, and the North Shore Water Commission will no longer be responsible for lead and copper monitoring.</p>
<p>Please note that lead and copper do not have a maximum contaminant level. Instead they have an action level (AL). To determine compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule, all results collected from monitoring event are arranged lowest to highest and the 90th percentile value is determined. If the 90th percentile value is at or below the AL, no additional action is required<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Please note that "level found" in this section is the 90th percentile value from the latest monitoring event. Of the 92 samples collected, 6 of the lead samples exceeded the action level of 15 ppb.</p>

<p>To reduce the amount of lead that can transfer from lead-bearing fixtures and pipes to the water, the NSWC feeds a corrosion inhibitor that contains phosphate. The addition of phosphate has been determined by the EPA and WNDR to be the best available treatment process for controlling lead in the distribution system.</p>
<p><em>Unregulated Contaminants</em></p>
<p>Unregulated contaminants are those for which EPA has not established drinking water standards. The purpose of unregulated contaminant monitoring is to assist EPA in determining the occurrence of unregulated contaminants in drinking water and whether future regulation is warranted. EPA required us to participate in this monitoring.</p>

<p><em>Other Unregulated Contaminants</em></p>
<p>Unregulated contaminants are those for which EPA has not established drinking water standards. The purpose of unregulated contaminant monitoring is to assist EPA in determining the occurrence of unregulated contaminants in drinking water and whether future regulation is warranted. EPA required us to participate in this monitoring.</p>

<h2 id="source-water-assessment">Source Water Assessment</h2>
<p>The North Shore Water Commission purifies water from Lake Michigan. The latest evaluation by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) indicates our source water quality is susceptible to pollution and contaminants. Preserving the water quality of Lake Michigan is essential to maintaining your drinking water quality. For more information on the impacts to your source of drinking water, see the Source Water Assessment for North Shore Water Commission at <a href="http://northshorewater.org/images/materials/SWA-2002.pdf">http://northshorewater.org/images/materials/SWA-2002.pdf</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="education-information">Education Information</h2>
<p>The sources of drinking water, both tap water and bottled water, include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Contaminants that may be present in source water include the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Microbial contaminants</strong>, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations and wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Inorganic contaminants</strong>, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.</p>
<p><strong>Pesticides and herbicides</strong>, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff and residential uses.</p>
<p><strong>Organic chemical contaminants</strong>, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff and septic systems.</p>
<p><strong>Radioactive contaminants</strong>, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which should provide the same protection for public health.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="health-information">Health Information</h2>
<p>Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water hotline at (800) 426-4791. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune systems disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water hotline.</p>
<h3 id="lead-health-effects">Lead Health Effects</h3>
<p>Infants and children who drink water containing lead in excess of the action level could experience delays in their physical or mental development. Children could show slight deficits in attention span and learning abilities. Adults who drink this water over many years could develop kidney problems or high blood pressue.</p>
<h3 id="additional-lead-information">Additional Lead Information</h3>
<p>If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. North Shore Water Commission and your water utility are responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 3 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead">http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead</a>.</p>
<p>The North Shore Health Department is another valuable resource. They can provide you with more information about the health effects of lead and how to test for lead in your home. Visit their website at <a href="http://www.nshealthdept.org">http://www.nshealthdept.org</a> or call (414) 371-2980.</p>

<h2 id="treatment-process">Treatment Process</h2>
<p>Our treatment process starts when water enters our intake crib located in Lake Michigan. Bar screens prevent large objects from entering the intake, and a mussel control system prevents zebra and quagga mussels from accumulating in our pipes and equipment.</p>
<p>Gravity forces the water to fill a large shorewell that has several raw water pumps submersed in it. After passing through another screen, lake water is pumped from this station to the main treatment plant.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the main facility, aluminum sulfate (alum) and polymer are added to promote settling of solids. This water then travels very slowly through a system of rectangular basins that provide a location for particulate matter to accumulate.</p>
<p>Rapid sand filters remove the remaining particulate matter and clean water is stored in a clearwell below the filters. There are intermediate pumps (sometimes referred to as transfer or low lift pumps) which force the filtered water through a fully redundant ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system which inactivates pathogens such as cryptosporidium. Before entering the UV reactors, fluoride is added to the water to prevent tooth decay. After passing through the UV reactors, sodium hypochlorite (a form of chlorine) is added to the water to disinfect any remaining pathogens.</p>
<p>Underground piping directs the water to our chlorine contact-time clearwells. While in these clearwells, chlorine has sufficient time to disinfect the water.</p>
<p>Our high service pumps draws water from these clearwells into a chemical feed vault where ammonium hydroxide (also referred to as aqua ammonia) and phosphate are added. The ammonium hydroxide converts the chlorine to another disinfectant, chloramine, that is used by neighboring communities and can reduce disinfection by-products formation in the distribution system. Phosphate is also added at this point to reduce lead and copper leaching within pipes and plumbing fixtures in your home.</p>
<p>Water leaving the main facility is metered as it enters the mains of the member communities. Within the distribution systems of Fox Point, Glendale, and Whitefish Bay, there are metered interconnections that are kept open to improve pressure and water quality. The NSWC also reads and maintains these meters.</p>
