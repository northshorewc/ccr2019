    <h2>Health Information</h2>
    <p>Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).</p>
    <p>Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune systems disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Environmental Protection Agency's safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).</p>

    <h2>Educational Information</h2>
    <p>The sources of drinking water, both tap water and bottled water, include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.</p>
    <p>Contaminants that may be present in source water include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations and wildlife.</li>
        <li>Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally- occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.</li>
        <li>Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff and residential uses.</li>
        <li>Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff and septic systems.</li>
        <li>Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. FDA regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which shall provide the same protection for public health.</p>

    <h2>Detected Contaminants</h2>
    <p>Your water was tested for many contaminants last year. We are allowed to monitor for some contaminants less frequently than once a year.  The following tables list only those contaminants which were detected in your water.  If a contaminant was detected last year, it will appear in the following tables without a sample date.  If the contaminant was not monitored last year, but was detected within the last 5 years, it will appear in the tables below along with the sample date.</p>

    <h3>Additional Health Information</h3>
                <p>If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. Whitefish Bay Waterworks is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.</p>




        <h3>Purchased Water</h3>
